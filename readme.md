# reactive-touch

Configurable touch bindings for [reactive](https://github.com/component/reactive) with [Hammer](https://hammerjs.github.io/). Use `on-swipe`, `on-tap`, `on-rotate` and many more in your reactive views. Also supports bindings for custom events, like `on-doubletap`.

[![Build Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/reactive-touch-sauce.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vweevers/reactive-touch)

See [Hammer browser support](https://hammerjs.github.io/browser-support.html) and [reactive](https://github.com/component/reactive) for actual browser support.

## Quickstart

```js
var reactive = require('reactive')
  , touch = require('reactive-touch')

var tpl  = '<div on-swipeleft="swipe">Swipe left</div>'
var view = reactive(tpl, null, {
  bindings: touch(),
  delegate: {
    swipe: function(ev, ctx) {
      console.log('you swiped left')
    }
  }
})
```

## Live example

See the [live example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vweevers/reactive-touch/blob/master/example/index.html)! It demonstrates most features:

- Custom recognizers
- Reactive enabling of events
- Per-element and per-view options
- Default handler names

## Usage

`touch([bindings][, options])` extends your bindings object or if none given, creates a new bindings object. Both arguments are optional, see below for `options`.

>**Breaking change:** before 1.0.0, the plugin was loaded with `view.use(touch)`. This created problems with reactive's `each` binding and scope, because a reactive instance renders immediately ([reactive#126](https://github.com/component/reactive/issues/126))

Your view can react to any Hammer event by adding element attributes in the form of `on-[event]="handler name"`. If no handler name is given, it is assumed to be the event name. These are the same:

```html
<div on-pan></div>
<div on-pan="pan"></div>
```

The handler will receive two arguments, similar to reactive's built-in `on-click`:

- `ev`: event data
- `ctx`: reactive instance

### Options

Each element with one or more touch bindings, gets his own [set of recognizers](https://hammerjs.github.io/getting-started.html#more-control). Recognizers can be configured per-view and per-element.

#### Per-element: option attributes

Add attributes in the form of `[recognizer]-[option]="value"`. Values will be interpolated if wrapped in brackets, and cast to integers, floats or booleans if necessary. Examples:

```html
<div on-pan pan-direction="horizontal"></div>
<div on-rotateend="rotate" rotate-threshold="{ modelProperty + 10 }"></div>
<div on-swipe swipe-velocity="0.65" swipe-direction="24"></div>
<div on-tap tap-taps="2">double tap</div>
<div on-tap tap-setup="specialTap"></div>
<div on-pinch on-rotate pinch-with="rotate"></div>
<div on-press press-enable="{ someMethod }"></div>
```

#### Per-view 

Group options by lowercase recognizer name:

```js
touch(bindings, {
  swipe: {
    threshold: 100
  }
})
```

### Custom recognizers

Simply add a group to `options`, like "doubletap" below. Optionally set `recognizer`, required if the custom recognizer's name doesn't contain a standard name. In the example, `recognizer` could have been left out.

```html
<div on-tap on-doubletap></div>
```

```js
touch(bindings, {
  tap: {
    requireFailure: 'doubletap'
  },
  doubletap: {
    recognizer: 'Tap',
    taps: 2,
    with: 'tap'
  }
})
```

### List of events and options

#### Common options

| Option           | Description
|:-----------------|:--------------
| *enable*         | If `false`, no events will be emitted. Defaults to `true`.
| *with*           | A lowercase recognizer name (e.g. `tap` or `mycustomtap`) to recognize simultaneously. Shortcut for [recognizeWith()](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognize-with/).
| *requireFailure* | A lowercase recognizer name that is required to fail before recognizing. Shortcut for [requireFailure()](http://hammerjs.github.io/require-failure/).
| *setup*          | A view method name, called after recognizer is created and options are set. For advanced usage. Receives three arguments: `el`, `recognizer` and `ctx`.

#### Specifics

For **direction**, use a numerical value (from `Hammer.DIRECTION_*` constants) or a shorthand like `all`, `horizontal`, `left`, etc.

Please follow the links below for a description of the other options and the events.

| Recognizer | Events   | Options  
|:-----------|:---------|:------------------
| [Swipe](https://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-swipe/) | swipe, swipeleft, swiperight, swipeup, swipedown | threshold, pointers, direction, velocity
| [Pan](https://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/) | pan, panstart, panmove, panend, pancancel, panleft, panright, panup, pandown | pointers, threshold, direction
| [Pinch](https://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pinch/) | pinch, pinchstart, pinchmove, pinchend, pinchcancel, pinchin, pinchout | pointers, threshold
| [Rotate](https://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-rotate/) | rotate, rotatestart, rotatemove, rotateend, rotatecancel | pointers, threshold
| [Tap](https://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-tap/) | tap | pointers, taps, interval, time, threshold, posThreshold
