# reactive-touch

Configurable touch bindings for [reactive](https://github.com/component/reactive) with [Hammer](https://hammerjs.github.io/). Use on-swipe, on-tap, on-rotate and many more in your reactive views.

[![Build Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/reactive-touch-sauce.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vweevers/reactive-touch)

See [Hammer browser support](https://hammerjs.github.io/browser-support.html) and [reactive](https://github.com/component/reactive) for actual browser support.

## Example

```html
<div on-swipeleft="slide" swipe-distance="50" swipe-enable="{active}">
Swipe here
</div>
```

```js
var reactive = require('reactive')
  , touch = require('reactive-touch')

var model = { active: false }
var view  = reactive(template, model, {
  bindings: touch(),
  delegate: {
    slide: function(ev, ctx) {
      console.log('you swiped left')
      console.log(ev.distance > 50) // true
    }
  }
})

view.set('active', true)
```

## Usage

`touch([bindings])` extends your bindings object or if none given, creates a new bindings object. 

>**Breaking change:** before 1.0.0, the plugin was loaded with `view.use(touch)`. This created problems with reactive's `each` binding and scope, because a reactive instance renders immediately (before `use()`). See (TODO: link to issue)

Your view can react to any Hammer event by adding element attributes in the form of `on-[event]="handler name"`. If no handler name is given, it is assumed to be the event name. These are the same:

```html
<div on-pan></div>
<div on-pan="pan"></div>
```

The handler will receive two arguments, similar to reactive's built-in `on-click`:

- `ev`: event data
- `ctx`: reactive instance

### Option attributes

Each element with one or more touch bindings, gets his own [set of recognizers](https://hammerjs.github.io/getting-started.html#more-control). A recognizer can be configured with attributes in the form of `[recognizer]-[option]="value"`. Values will be interpolated if wrapped in brackets, and cast to integers, floats or booleans if necessary. Examples:

```html
<div on-pan pan-direction="horizontal"></div>
<div on-rotateend="rotate" rotate-threshold="{ modelProperty + 10 }"></div>
<div on-swipe swipe-velocity="0.65" swipe-direction="24"></div>
<div on-tap tap-taps="2">double tap</div>
<div on-tap tap-setup="specialTap"></div>
<div on-pinch on-rotate pinch-with="rotate">TODO</div>
<div on-press press-enable="{ someMethod }"></div>
```

### TODO: custom events

```html
<div on-tap on-doubletap></div>
```

```js
touch(bindings, {
  tap: {
    requireFailure: 'doubletap'
  },
  doubletap: {
    recognizer: 'Tap', // auto?
    taps: 2,
    recognizeWith: 'tap'
  }
})
```

### List of events and options

Every recognizer has the `enable` and `setup` options.

**enable**: if `false`, no events will be emitted. Defaults to `true`.

**setup**: a view method name, called after recognizer is created and options are set. For advanced usage (i.e., if you need `recognizeWith` or `requireFailure`). Receives three arguments:

- `el`
- `recognizer`: Hammer Recognizer instance
- `ctx`: Reactive instance

See [todo: link to example] for an example implementation of a tap combined with a double tap.

For **direction**, use a numerical value (from `Hammer.DIRECTION_*` constants) or a shorthand like `all`, `horizontal`, `left`, etc.

Please follow the links below for a description of the other options and the events.
